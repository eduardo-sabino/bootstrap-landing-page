# Web News

This is a project I worked on to practise UI/UX Design, CSS, and Bootstrap fundamentals. I also used an API called **News API**.

## how to use:
    npm install
#### 
    npm run dev

### **obs:**
Don't forget to go to **https://newsapi.org/** to *Get Your API Key*, then paste it in a **.env** file created by you in the _root folder_(**bootstrap-landing-page**). The name of the variable found in the .env file must be **NEWS_KEY**
